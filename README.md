# 🧠 Sepehr's Notebooks Hub

This repo is where I store my general ML notebooks. It usually contains the competitions, experiments, and simple notebooks.
I don't keep my bigger projects in here.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder = one competition or an simple experiment with a dataset.  
Inside: Notebooks, maybe data and also I may have multiple notebooks for different implementations.
